# Enterprise-Data-Engineering-Sales-Analytics-Using-Azure-

This project showcases a complete cloud-based data pipeline and sales analytics solution using Microsoft Azure services and Power BI. It uses the Adventure Works dataset to simulate a retail environment, enabling real-time insights and business intelligence.

In this project I have ingested raw data and converted to json and uploaded it to github, then used azure Data Factory to bring data into Azure Data Lake, proccesed the data in Databricks and then organised it in  Bronze–Silver–Gold layered architecture.Finally I have loaded the data into Azure Synapse for analytics and used Power BI for visual representation of the data.
